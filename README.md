# Direct and social effects of feeding duration in pigs 
This repository contains codes and data needed to reproduce results in Angarita Barajas et al. Estimation of direct and social effects of feeding duration in growing pigs using   record from automatic feeding stations.

> To fit different mixed models to estimate direct and social effects on the feeding time (visit length) of group-housed pigs.

## General info
This repository contains codes and data needed to reproduce results in the bayesian estimation of covariance componentes fitting
 three different models on feeding duration trait and to calculate the correlation between feeding duration and production traits.
